# PowerBI Report Format

This file describes the individual pages created in the Power BI pbix file. Four pages were created and named as follows

- Executive Summary
- Customer Detail
- Product Detail
- Stores Map

A theme was also selected.

## Navigation Sidebar

A sidebar was created using a rectangle shape covering a narrow strip on the left side of the page. This can be seen below, together with backgrounds for cards

## Customer Detail Page

The following elements were created

- Card visual for Total Unique Customers
- Card visual for Revenue per Customer (New measure required - [Revenue per Customer](Dax_measures.md#revenue-per-customer))
- Donut chart showing the total customers for each country using the Users[Country] column to filter the [Total Customers] measure
- Column Chart visual showing the number of customers who purchased each product category, using the Products[Category] column to filter the [Total Customers] measure. Added a trend line with 10 periods and 95% confidence
- Top 20 Customers Table displaying the top 20 customers, filtered by revenue with their full name, revenue, and number of orders.
  - When creating this table it was observed that simply using the [Full Name] field from the customers table would give an incorrect list as it was collating the revenue based on a customers name which is not unique (for example there are multiple Eleanor Williams). Therefore the [User ID] field was used as a hidden column to make the customers unique and also to drive the top 20 filter (using Top N filter type)

  - Added conditional formatting to the revenue column, to display data bars for the revenue values and colour highlighting of higher order numbers.
- Top Customer Cards showing the Top Customer by Revenue and the number of orders made by the customer and the total revenue generated by the customer.
  - These needed to use the same [User ID] filtering as the Top 20 Customer Table but with a Top N where N = 1.
  - Date Slicer - Added and used the [Year] column in the Date table in the 'between' style.

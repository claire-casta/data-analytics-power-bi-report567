# PowerBI Report Format

This file describes the individual pages created in the Power BI pbix file. Four pages were created and named as follows

- Executive Summary
- Customer Detail
- Product Detail
- Stores Map

A theme was also selected.

## Navigation Sidebar

A sidebar was created using a rectangle shape covering a narrow strip on the left side of the page. This can be seen below, together with backgrounds for cards

## Customer Detail Page

The following elements were created to focus on customer-level analysis.

- Card visual for Total Unique Customers
- Card visual for Revenue per Customer (New measure required - [Revenue per Customer](Dax_measures.md#revenue-per-customer))
- Donut chart showing the total customers for each country using the Users[Country] column to filter the [Total Customers] measure
- Column Chart visual showing the number of customers who purchased each product category, using the Products[Category] column to filter the [Total Customers] measure. Added a trend line and a projection with 10 periods and 95% confidence
- Top 20 Customers Table displaying the top 20 customers, filtered by revenue with their full name, revenue, and number of orders.
  - When creating this table it was observed that simply using the [Full Name] field from the customers table would give an incorrect list as it was collating the revenue based on a customers name which is not unique (for example there are multiple Eleanor Williams). Therefore the [User ID] field was used as a hidden column to make the customers unique and also to drive the top 20 filter (using Top N filter type)
  -

  - Added conditional formatting to the revenue column, to display data bars for the revenue values and colour highlighting of higher order numbers.
- Top Customer Cards showing the Top Customer by Revenue and the number of orders made by the customer and the total revenue generated by the customer.
  - These needed to use the same [User ID] filtering as the Top 20 Customer Table but with a Top N where N = 1.
  - Date Slicer - Added and used the [Year] column in the Date table in the 'between' style. 
  
Below is a final screenshot of the page. The layout chosen is different to the examples given as a title has been added for easy visual ID of the page that is being viewed as this report could be viewed outside of PowerBI (such as a powerpoint). The key metric cards are displayed at the tope of the page to draw the viewers attention

## Executive Summary Page

This is a report page that focuses on high level executive summary which allowed viewers to quickly get insights and outcomes on performance accross the company as a whole. The visual style of the customer detail page has been followed and elements reused where possible to keep consistency. 

The following elements have been added

-  Card Visual for Total Revenue to 2 decimal place
-  Card Visual for Total Orders to 1 decimal place
-  Card Visual for Total Profit to 2 decimal place
-  Revenue Trending Line chart with [Total Revenue} against the date hierarchy down to Month. Added a trend line and a projection with 10 periods and 95% confidence
-  Donut Chart to show [Total Revenue] by Store[Country] which details the revenue by country.
-  Donut Chart to show [Total Revenue] by Store[Store Type] which details the revenue by store type.
-  Bar Chart (horizontal) to show [Total Orders by Category] with data labels to 1 decimal place.
-  KPI Visuals to show KPIs for Quarterly Revenue, Orders and Profit
   -  For each of these a measure for the previous quarters performance was created which are documented [here](Dax_measures.md).
   -  Then a Target measure for each was created which was set at 105% of the performance of the previous quarter. These are documented [here](Dax_measures.md).
   -  KPI Visual created for each with values at 1 decimal place.
   -  The Trend Axis was set to on and the following properties set
       - Direction : High is Good
       - Bad Colour : red
       - Transparency : 15%

On the example layout there was a table with the top 10 products and detail on revenue etc but this did not appear in the tasks for this page. On consideration of this table, I feel that it is too much detail for a high level executive summary. More detail on 10 top products will be availible on the Product Detail page which can easily be provided if that information is required.

Below is a final screenshot of the page. Again the  layout chosen is different to the examples given as a title has been added for easy visual ID of the page that is being viewed as this report could be viewed outside of PowerBI (such as a powerpoint). The key metric cards are displayed at the tope of the page to draw the viewers attention.
